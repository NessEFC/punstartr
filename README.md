## Notes from the team

### Cody


### Jack
For twilio, trial accounts only allow you to send to confirmed numbers (basically just whoever is associated with the account) the text confirmation is set up to not pull the users phone number, but to the trial accounts confirmed number (mine). You should set yourself up with a trial account and change the appropriate application.yml keys and the associated number. As a workaround, 1234 or the sent code will always pass the confirmation code.
### Josh

- For user authentication, we're using [sorcery](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery)
- [this guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/magical-authentication-sorcery/) is what got it working. Top notch!
